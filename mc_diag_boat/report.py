) -> list[str]:
    """Format the given sequences as index-aligned strings.

    This function aligns the string representations of elements of sequences
    to make them easier to read when printed as subsequent lines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `sequences` : `Sequence[Sequence]`
        The sequences to format, ordered row-first.
        E.g., `(("a", 0), ("b", 1))` -> `["a 0", "b 1"]`
    `align` : `Literal["L", "R", "C"]` or `Sequence` thereof, default "L"
        A character or sequence of characters indicating whether column elements
        should be aligned left (L), right (R), or center (C). If a character is
        given, all columns will be aligned according to it. If a sequence is given,
        it must have the same number of elements as the second-level sequences
        provided in `sequences`.
    `separator` : `str`, default `" "`
        The string to add between each column element in the final strings.

    Returns
    -------
    `rows` : `list[str]`
        The list of strings with each element spaced according to the maximum length
        of any other element in that column, aligned according to `align`.
